CRF chunking with word representations
--------------------------------------

    scripts and steps by Joseph Turian

A standard baseline in NLP is chunking (shallow parsing), which was the
CoNLL 2000 shared task. Training a CRF is a standard approach to this task
(Sha + Pereira 2003). In fact, many CRF implementations include
instructions for reimplementing the Sha+Pereira chunker with identical
features:
    crfsgd: http://leon.bottou.org/projects/sgd
    crf++: http://crfpp.sourceforge.net/
    CRFsuite: http://www.chokkan.org/software/crfsuite/

We use CRFsuite because it makes it simple to modify the feature
generation code, so one can easily add new features.

We have instructions and scripts for how we add word representations
(Brown clusters and/or word embeddings) to the training.
